Home to almost 10,000 vendors, youâ€™ll find everything from vintage sneakers to comic books and Thai handicrafts being sold here. You name it, Chatuchak probably sells it. The market is a great place to pick up souvenirs, but be sure to bargain for a good price. After a day of shopping and strolling around, the lush green lanes of Chatuchak Park are a welcome relief.</div>",
